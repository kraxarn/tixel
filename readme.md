A port of my [4mb-platformer](https://github.com/kraxarn/4mb-platformer) project to [KTX](https://libktx.github.io/)
with focus on mobile platforms. Requires Java 11+ on desktop platforms.

Some useful commands used together with `gradlew`:

- `lwjgl3:run`: run desktop version.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: build desktop version, jar file can be found in `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
